        <h1 class="uk-heading-divider">Introduction</h1>
            <p>The Euros 2020 were supposed to be played between 12 June - 12 July for the first time across several host nations to commemorate its' 60th anniversary.
            It would have been a summer full of memorable goals, underdog stories, last-minute winners and a tournament that would be remembered for many years after its' completion.</p>
            <p>However, due to the global Covid-19 pandemic, it's rather a summer confined to the four-walls of our own homes, in which we are forced to watch replays of Greece's unlikely success in 2004, Spain's tiki-taka dominance inbetween 2008 and 2012, and England's disappointing exit against Iceland in 2016,
              as UEFA Euro 2020 was officially rescheduled to 11 June - 11 July 2021.</p>
            <p>So here is a <span class="uk-text-bold">countdown until the start of UEFA Euro 2021</span></p>

      <div class="uk-grid-small uk-child-width-auto" uk-grid uk-countdown="date: 2021-06-11T21:00:00+00:00">

              <p>As you can see, it's still quite a long way to go. So you could either stick around and watch the clock run down or continue to find out, which nation would have won UEFA Euro 2020, if the tournament would have taken place this year.</p>

            <h3>*Note</h3>
              <p>This is a simulation of the entire tournament and could be a long read, so feel free to jump straight to the result or the stages of your interest via the navigation bar.</p>
              <p>The prediction of the tournament and the games is based on data in the form statistics, head-to-head records and form, but also heavily realiant on subjectivity as football can often be unpredictable. All teams marked with * are unconfirmed teams as they still need to qualify through the play-offs.</p>

            <li>According to the odds and our predictions, Italy would finish this group with ease. The team was only one of two teams that won all of their qualification matches and with splendid attacking football, scoring an average of 3.7 goals, the Italians top group A.</li>
            <li>Turkey's defense could have led them to a surprise second spot in group A, having only conceded 0.2 goals per game in a group with France. Although an offensively inexperienced side, our predictions see Turkey go through the group stages.</li>
            <li>Switzerland is one of the most consistent sides in international football, having qualified for the round of 16 in four major tournaments in a row. However, even with Xherdan Shaqiri in the side, who has missed almost all qualification games, we predict the Swiss will only finish third in the group.</li>
            <li>Although Wales' was able to make an impressive run four years ago in the UEFA Euro 2016, the team arguably declined in this timespan. They could potentially still have an impact with young players such as Daniel James coming through, but the Dragons take the last spot in this group according to our predictions.</li>

            <li>Denmark cause the first upset in the tournament by beating Belgium to top spot of group B. This is due to the fact that the nation has a strong spine, has not lost a single game during the qualification and plays all their group matches at home.</li>
            <li>Belgium's golden generation is aware that this could be one of the last chances to win a major trophy and are quality-wise the strongest team in group B. Although they have won all of their qualification matches and are second-favourites to win the tournament, they still only finish second in our predictions.</li>
            <li>Russia's starting eleven has completely changed in the two years since hosting the World Cup in 2018, some players retired (Igo Akinfeev, Sergei Ignashevich) others have been injured (Alan Dzagoev) or were replaced (Fyodor Smolov), leaving a young and unexperienced, but strong side. We predict the young Russians would finish third in the group.</li>
            <li>This would've been Finalnd's first time at the Euros. They did not play the best qualification (4 losses) and are clearly the least likely of the teams to qualify for the next round. Only 4 players of the squad (Teemu Pukki, Lukas Hradecky, Fredrik Jensen and Jesse Joronen) play in Europe's top five leagues, leaving Filand to finsih at the bottom of the group.</li>

According to FedEx four out of the top five performers of the qualification and UEFA Nations League are Dutch and include Depay, De Jong, De Ligt and Cillessen. Furthermore, the Dutch are playing all three matches at home in Amsterdam.</li>
          <li>Austria has not made it past the group stages on the two times they have qualified in 2008 and 2016. However, in the last group match against Ukraine, Austria edges the win. A mixture between experienced players like Alaba and Arnautovic with young talents like Laimer and Sabitzer is the key to this crucial win and second spot.</li>
          <li>Romania, the surprise of play-off path A, manage to grab third place in the group. Although quality-wise weaker than the Ukraine, a historically better head-to-head record and home advantage in the group are crucial for Romania's two draws.</li>

      <li>Sweden has only built on their success in the 2018 World Cup, with most of the squad still intact. Adding to this one of Europe's most exciting young strikers Alexander Isak, we predict that the Swedes make it past the group stages once more.</li>
      <li>Although individually on par or even better than Sweden, Poland seems to struggle in major competitions.

        <li>World Champions France must be disappointed by finishing second in the group. However, as seen in their loss against Turkey in the qualifiers, France could have a bad day at the office and draw against Portugal, which would then lead to a second-placed finish.</li>

          <p>Historically Turkey has been the better team between both of them, however, the last game was played in 2010, which was when Belgium’s golden generation was still at the start of their career (Hazard, De Bruyne, Lukaku etc.). We can expect a game that Belgium dominates as seen through their average ball possession (58.23% in the last 40 games) and goals per game (3.24), both of which are higher than Turkeys 54,91% and 1.43. Turkey has had 63 yellow cards compared to Belgiums 32 in the last 40 games, which shows Turkey’s hard-tackling defensive approach to games.</p>
          <p>Even though Turkey’s defence has been their strong point throughout the tournament and qualification, it could be that under the immense pressure of the Belgium team, Turkey would eventually receive a red card and shift the game in favour to the Red Devils.</p>
          <p>All in all it is a very competitive game in which Belgium manages a narrow win over a defensively strong Turkey side that tried to recreate Greece’s success in 2004.</p>

          <p>Although this game is a replay of the 2019 UEFA Nations League finale, which Portugal won 1-0, and head-to-head Portugal seems to be dominating, it is one of the more competitive match-ups in the round of 16 as Netherlands also won one friendly between them 3-0 in March 2018. Both teams had very similar statistics for the last 40 games (POR/NED, 58.00%/59.17% possession, 2.25/2.17 goals per game etc.) and are both quality-wise also on a very high-level, with individual players that could tip the game one way or another. However, as this is a prediction of the tournament, bold decisions have to be made and we believe that it is likely that Portugal is going to lose this match.</p>
          <p>The nation has relied on Cristiano Ronaldo’s goals for many years, however, the last time that Ronaldo has scored more than 3 goals for Portugal in the Euros was back in 2008. Combine this with his declining xG (expected goals per season), from over 35xg to only 17xg over the last 5 seasons and a very strong Netherlands defence, it could be hard for Portugal to break down the Dutch side. Although players like De Ligt, De Jong or Depay might not have had the best seasons with their clubs, when they play with their national team, it seems to click, which is evident as they are 3 of the best five performers throughout the qualifiers and the Nations League according to the FedEx Peformance Zone.</p>
          <p>It is therefore a very competitive game, but the Dutch will just about make it past the Portuguese in this simulation.</p>

          <p>As much as I, as a fellow Austrian myself, would have loved for my country to beat Italy, there was not a single piece of statistic I could use to argue my way through to an Austrian win. Be it ball possession, shots per game, goals conceded, clean sheets and even corners, the Austrian side seemed to be worse in everything compared to Italy. Although it breaks my heart, this is probably one of the most straightforward games in the round of 16 and should be a comfortable victory for the Italian side.</p>
          <p>Ciro Immobile, who often outscores his xG90 (expected goals per 90 minutes) of 0.83 and the Italians attacking quality bully the weaker Austrian defence in this game. Despite the loss, the Austrian side should be proud to make it into the round of 16 for the first time in their history.</p>

          <p>It’s the battle of the underdogs and one of them might just become the surprise of the tournament. Denmark has played incredibly well until now in the tournament, topping the group with Belgium and Russia, but bearing mind their advantage of playing at home. Norway on the other hand has been one of the dark horses of the tournament with Erling Haaland and Martin Oedegaard impressing on the big stage.</p>
          <p>However, Denmark’s spine is one of the strongest of the tournament with Poulsen/Braithwaite, Eriksen, Delaney, Christensen/Kjaer and Schmeichel and is quality-wise much stronger than Norway. The head-to-head record also speaks for itself and this results in a comfortable victory for a strong Denmark side.</p>

          <p>The last time these two met was a friendly in November 2018, it resulted in a complete disaster for the Russian team. Without a single shot on target and only 32% ball possession, the German team won comfortably 3-0 and we are predicting a similar result.</p>
          <p>Germany’s failure at the 2018 world cup and a reshuffle of the whole squad, where former world cup winners, Müller, Boateng and Hummels were told that they were surplus to requirements and the controversial retirement of Özil, has rejuvenated the side. Players like Gnabry (13 goals in 13 games), Havertz or Werner will be looking forward to make their mark in the national team. </p>
          <p>Even though Russia made it through a tough group with Belgium, Denmark and Romania, the German’s historical domination and sheer quality throughout the whole squad makes it an easy win.</p>

          <p>This is a very interesting game between the runners-up Croatia and quarter-finalists Sweden of the previous world cup, two teams that are used to exceeding expectations in recent times. Although some predictions and the bookmakers might argue that Croatia would have a better chance of winning this match, the truth is that it is more complicated than that.</p>
          <p>After the World Cup, the Croatian team arguably declined and Sweden only built on their previous run. Some established stars like Rakitic have lost their place in the starting eleven and Croatia has been somewhat shaky throughout the qualifiers, having drawn against ‘weaker’ teams like Azerbaijan, Hungary or Wales. Sweden meanwhile controlled their group and lost only one game against group leaders Spain and have exciting striking talent like Aleksander Isak coming through the team.</p>
          <p>The prediction is that while Croatia (55.25% ball possession, 3.86 shots per game) probably dominates the game, Sweden’s more defensive-focused and transition based football (47.78% ball possession, 5.2 shots per game) will come in handy against an aging Croatian squad.</p>

          <p>This is the game, it’s make or break for the Three Lions, who despite their impressive semi-final run at the 2018 World Cup, need to finally prove that they can make it past the very best. Both teams have played incredible qualifications and only had one bad day at the office, England against Czech Republic and France against Turkey, but either of them have only improved from the previous tournament.</p>
          <p>While France’s strongest eleven will stay more or less the same compared to 2018, with Lenglet replacing Umtiti the only exception, England will have a stronger squad than 2 years prior. The strongest addition for England will come in the form of Jadon Sancho, who established himself as one of the most consistent attacking threats in the Bundesliga by constantly outscoring and assisting his xG (0.41/game) and xA (0.43/game). The youngster, who has scored 14 goals and provided 15 assists in only 23 Bundesliga appearances this season will possibly form a deadly partnership with Harry Kane, who hit the back of the net 12 times during the qualification and give something for France to deal with.</p>
          <p>We believe that the game would have been a highly intense, front-to-end match with both teams going for it. Either of the teams’ attacking prowess and also defensive stability will make for an exciting game, however, for this one we are siding with the bookmakers and send the favourites of the tournament through to the Quarter-finals and one step closer to Wembley.</p>

          <p>Will Switzerland finally make it past the round of 16 in a major tournament? Well, in Spain they definitely have an immense hurdle to overcome to achieve a historical result for the nation. Spain played an immaculate qualification, having went 10 games unbeaten, but at the same time, this is not the same Spain squad of a decade ago that went on to win 3 major tournaments in a row with their tiki-taka football. Most of the successful squad is gone and this is a team that has not made it past the round of 16 in three consecutive tournaments. While Spain has some exciting talent coming through the ranks, like Fati, Olmo or Oyarzabal, this game could be much closer than many would predict. </p>
          <p>Either way, one of these teams are destined to break their round of 16 ‘curse’, but we predict that it is going to be a repeat of both teams’ 2018 match-up and end in a 1-1 draw at full-time. With hard-working and physically strong players like Xhaka, Zakaria and Akanji, we predict that the Swiss just about manage to drag the 1-1 result over the final-whistle, which results in a historical penalty-shootout that sees the alpine nation make it through to the next round.</p>
          <p id="results_16">Even though Spain was the much better team on the field, bad luck and a tough Swiss side showed that it was not meant to be for La Furia Roja at this year’s Euros.</p>

            <p>“When they are down, when they are tested, they find a win!”, who does not remember Toni Kroos’ freekick from the narrowest of angles in the 90+5 minute to clinch a 2-1 victory for the Germans against Sweden in the 2018 World Cup. It was such a high-paced game, Germany was pressing extremely high-up the pitch and left themselves vulnerable on the break, which the Swedes used to their advantage.</p>
            <p>Although both teams have unarguably only improved in these two years, their playing philosophy has stayed the exact same, high-pressing possession against defensive transition football. However, the key difference to this rematch is that Germany has since then adopted the 3-4-3 formation in contrast to their traditional 4-2-3-1.</p>

              <p>The new 3 at the back formation would make it much more difficult for the Swedes to counter against and could potential lead to a comfortable victory for the Germans. We expect the Germans to have around 70% ball possession (average of the last 3 games between both sides) and be much more defensively stable compared to 2018.</p>

            <p>Italy’s head-to-head record and squad strength make them the clear favourites for this tie, however, what makes knockout competitions so exciting is that underdogs often upset the odds. When it comes to games like this, believe, form and team-spirit often becomes more important than simply quality.</p>
            <p>What brought Denmark this far into the tournament was not only their home advantage in the group stages and the lucky draw against a weaker Norway, but also a growing believe in their own qualities. We just have to look as far as to Wales back in 2016 (or Russia in 2008 and Greece in 2004 for that matter) to see that it is more than common to see underdog success stories during the Euros. Wales made it into the semi-finals past an extremely strong Belgium side, in a match that was absolutely no fluke, but rather a world-class display of the whole Welsh national team.</p>

Eriksen, Poulsen and Bruun Larsen are at the heart of Denmark’s astonishing performance against Italy. Even though most of the predictions until now are built on statistics, there is nothing more satisfying to see in the world of football than David beating Goliath.</p>

                <div class="uk-margin-top">
                  <p>Belgium’s golden generation against the Netherland’s upcoming golden generation, what an exciting match-up this is. Ever since Roberto Martinez took over the Belgium national team after UEFA Euro 2016 and incorporated the 3-4-3 formation, the team has been playing extraordinarily well, even topping the <a href="https://www.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/ranking-table/men/">FIFA world rankings</a>. After a third-place finish at the 2018 World Cup, the team will be extra motivated as this could be the last time that this generation of players (including Hazard, Mertens, De Bruyne, Vertonghen etc.) are able to challenge for a major title.</p>
                  <p>Despite their world-class starting eleven, which could possibly even be the best in the world, Belgium’s weakness lies in their squad depth. Playing a 3-4-3 formation requires high amounts of energy and tactical understanding of all the players in the team. However, unlike other teams like Germany, Belgium is lacking options to replace the stars in the starting eleven and we predict that this could lead to Belgians’ demise. Add to this Koeman’s Netherlands with their classical Dutch 4-3-3 total-football philosophy, it is going to be a very tough match. If two or three of the Belgian stars miss out on this game due to bookings or injuries, we believe that the game could pen in favour of the Dutch.</p>

                  <p>What makes the Netherlands extremely dangerous for Belgium is their adaptability to different situations, as the team can transition very fast and attack out wide via Promes and Bergwijn or keep the ball and play through the lines with a very technical backline (De ligt, Van Dijk, Blind) and midfield (De Jong, Wijnaldum, De Roon/Van De Beek). We predict that someone from the Belgium midfield might miss this match and let the Netherlands take control in the midfield, which ultimately decides the game, although there is not a lot that separate both sides.</p>

                    <p>Less than a year ago, when England faced Switzerland in the UEFA Nations League match for third place, it felt like the goal posts had a spell over them.

                    <p>This time around, the Three Lions are a much more complete team as mentioned before and Sancho, who has been a relevation so far in the tournament is once again a key figure for the English side.

        <p>No one could have expected such an equal head-to-head record between these two sides, as most teams will have a negative record against the Germans. Surprisingly, the last game between them ended in a 1-1 draw in 2017, however, it was a friendly in which Germany did experiment quite a bit with their starting eleven.</p>
        <p>Statistically, Germany is the better side than Denmark, averaging more possession, shots, passes, xG and much more on average, but the Danish are one of the toughest sides to beat in International Football, having not lost a single competitive game since missing out on Euro 2016, except two games in the 2018 World Cup, this team’s strength lies in its stability and lack of mistakes.</p>

The Danish do have the quality to surprise any opposition in the tournament, as seen in their 3-1 against Italy, and we predict that they could make it very difficult for the Germans. In the end, the game could see some goals as this match-up promises 2.5 goals on average. After a tough nerve-wrecking game it could be decided via a penalty shoot-out, in which Germany’s elite mentality sees them through into the final.</p>

      <div class="uk-margin-top">
        <p>England and the Netherlands meet once again in a semi-final. Just a year prior these two faced each other in a thrilling game in the semi-finals of the UEFA Nations League, a game that is remembered by its’ multiple individual mistakes by defenders that led to 3 of the 4 goals and a famous 3-1 win for the Dutch. However, this time around, the audience can expect a much more composed defence on either side.</p>
        <p>Having said that, the starting line-up of both sides will likely to be very similar to the one in the Nations League, with the only exceptions probably being Alexander-Arnold and Henderson replacing Walker and Rice/Delph. As a result, we predict that this match will develop similarly to the previous game. The last match, despite the highlights, was almost completely dominated by the Dutch (53% possession, 28 shots and 12 shots on target), with England having difficulties (47% possession, 15 shots and 3 shots on target) to establish any attacking rhythm.</p>
        <p>At the heart of all of this was Frenkie De Jong. The current Barcelona midfielder is regarded as a generational talent and even though he does not offer much threat in the attacking third of the pitch, remains incredibly calm under pressure and always finds the right positive pass to lead his team up the pitch from his defensive midfield position.</p>

        <p>What highlighted the previous match was a frustration on England’s side of losing control in midfield and running after the ball for majority of the game. Therefore, despite England’s world-class attacking threat, which brought the team past Switzerland and World Cup winners France, we predict that the Dutch will once again dominate the midfield and prevent the Three Lions' attacking talent from shining.</p>
